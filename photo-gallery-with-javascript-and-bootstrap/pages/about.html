                <h3 class="fs-4 font-cinzel mb-4 text-yellow-300">Our Mission</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">Film Gallery was born from a passion for analog photography and a desire to preserve the unique aesthetic qualities that film brings to photographic art. In an era dominated by digital perfection, we celebrate the imperfections, grain, and character that make film photography truly special.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4">Our collection features work from both established and emerging photographers who share our appreciation for traditional photographic processes. Each image in our gallery is captured on film, developed using time-honored techniques, and scanned with care to maintain the integrity of the original negative.</p>
                
                <h3 class="fs-4 font-cinzel mb-3 mt-5 text-yellow-300">The Film Advantage</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">Film photography offers a depth and texture that digital formats often struggle to replicate. The chemical process of film development creates unique variations in color, contrast, and grain that give each photograph its own personality. Unlike digital sensors that capture exactly what they see, film interprets light and color in ways that can surprise even the most experienced photographers.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4">We work with a variety of film formats including 35mm, medium format (120mm), and large format. Each format offers distinct advantages - from the portability of 35mm to the incredible detail captured by large format cameras. Our photographers carefully select film stocks based on the specific qualities they want to emphasize in their work.</p>
                
                <h3 class="fs-4 font-cinzel mb-3 mt-5 text-yellow-300">Preserving Analog Traditions</h3>
                <p>As digital technology continues to advance, we remain committed to keeping analog photography alive. We support film manufacturers, local labs, and photographers who continue to work with traditional methods. Through exhibitions, workshops, and this online gallery, we aim to educate new generations about the beauty and craftsmanship of film photography.</p>
